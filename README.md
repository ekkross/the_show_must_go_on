# the_show_must_go_on
Topic:  We’re trying to make show-hunting as easy as possible for Portland consumers.  Venues.  People.  Sales.

Team: Erin, Michael, Charles, and Alana

Roles: 
Michael - Leaflet and maps
Erin - Python, SQL, Flask
Alana - HTML/CSS
Charles - JavaScript, Chartjs

Data source: Ticketmaster API

Repo name: https://github.com/ekkross/the_show_must_go_on

We will use TicketMaster’s API to get data about venues, events, and prices.

We will then clean our data using Python and load it into a structured SQL database.

Next, we will create interactive maps and charts using JavaScript, Chartjs, and Leaflet (for maps).  These visualizations will be interactive using Event Listeners, drop downs, menus etc. to change the view of said charts.

The visualizations we will include are likely to be:
Map of Portland with multiple filtering methods to update the data displayed
Bar chart representing genre counts, ticket prices, etc.
Ideally, we will also be able to display seat maps for each venue when they are chosen from a dropdown menu.
We may also include data about total Portland sales on events in the last X months.
